# Recursion 

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.

## Types of Recursion:

Tail recursion: start recursion at the end.
Head recursion: start recursion at the beggining.
Linear recursion: calling in any part of the code that is not Tail or Head.
Tree recursion: is recursion calling multiple times.
Indirect recursion: recursion A call recursion B and recursion B call recursion A.
Nested recursion: return recursion function inside another recursive function.
