# Recursion 

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.

## Types of Recursion:

1. Tail recursion: start recursion at the end.
2. Head recursion: start recursion at the beggining.
3. Linear recursion: calling in any part of the code that is not Tail or Head.
4. Tree recursion: is recursion calling multiple times.
5. Indirect recursion: recursion A call recursion B and recursion B call recursion A.
6. Nested recursion: return recursion function inside another recursive function.
